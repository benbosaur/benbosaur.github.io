Three Different Types of Machine Learning:
**1. Supervised Learning** > Labelled data, Direct Feedback, Predict outcomes/future
**2. Unspervised Learning** > No labels, no feedback, find hidden structure in data
**3. Reinforcement Learning** > Decision Process, Reward System, Learn series of actions

**Supervised Learning**
Main goal is to label training data which allows to make predictictions about future data. Supervised referes to training examples such as data inputs where the desired labels are already known. 
**Process**
Lables / Training data -> Machine Learning Algorithm -> New data -> Predictive Model -> Prediction 
Email spam filtering is an example. Email is labelled a spam or not spam. This process is also called **a classification task**. If an outcome has a continuous value this is called **regression** . Essentially this is a best fit approach such as price, temperature, fuel usage etc
