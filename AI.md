Three Different Types of Machine Learning:
**1. Supervised Learning** > Labelled data, Direct Feedback, Predict outcomes/future
**2. Unspervised Learning** > No labels, no feedback, find hidden structure in data
**3. Reinforcement Learning** > Decision Process, Reward System, Learn series of actions
